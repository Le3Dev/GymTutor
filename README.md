## 📌 About

In the modern fitness world, many people train in various locations — from home gyms to parks or temporary gym memberships. GymTutor was created to solve the limitations imposed by traditional gyms that restrict access to workout plans and progress tracking.

With GymTutor, the user becomes the true owner of their fitness data. Personal trainers can create personalized training plans, track progress, and communicate with students — while students can access their workouts, register completed sessions, and maintain full visibility over their development.
